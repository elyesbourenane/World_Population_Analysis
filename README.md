# World Population Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores world population data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.pyplot. The dataset used in this analysis is stored in `world_population.csv`.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about countries including their rank, country code (CCA3), country name, capital, continent, population for various years (2022, 2020, 2015, 2010, 2000, 1990, 1980, 1970), area in square kilometers, population density per square kilometer, growth rate, and world population percentage.

## Initial Data Exploration

We start by loading the dataset using Pandas and display the first few rows to get an overview of the data structure. Additionally, we check for missing values and explore the data types of each column.

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are calculated to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset. This includes summary statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for numerical features.

## Data Preprocessing

We handle missing values by either dropping them or imputing them based on the context of the data. Furthermore, we convert the data type of certain columns and set display options for better readability.

## Correlation Analysis

We explore the correlation between different numerical features using a correlation matrix and visualize it using a heatmap. This helps us understand the relationships between variables.

## Continent-wise Analysis

We group the data by continent and calculate the mean population for each continent across different years. This allows us to compare population trends among different continents.

## Visualization

Various visualizations are created to better understand the data. This includes line plots showing the evolution of population over time for specific countries (e.g., Algeria, France), as well as box plots to visualize the distribution of population and other numerical features.

## Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis provides insights into global population trends and distributions, allowing for further analysis and interpretation.
